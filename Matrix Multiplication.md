# Matrix multiplication

Given are an integrar L (L &ge; 1), an array A\[0...L) of matrices and an array r\[0...L] of integers. Matrix A&sdot;i has r&sdot;i rows and r&sdot;(i+1) columns (matrix A&sdot;i is an r&sdot;i x r&sdot;(i+1) matrix). Problem: (&prod;p: 0&le;p<L: A&sdot;p) has to be computed as efficient as possible.
